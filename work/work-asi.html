            <div class="workDescription">
                <p>From March to September 2021, I worked as a Newsletter Manager and Video Editor for Art Sphere Inc – a Philadelphia-based non-profit institution dedicated to delivering artistic and educational services to underserved neighborhoods in the region. This page is a sample of some of the work I did over the course of my term there. </p>

                <u><b>THE ASI BULLETIN</b></u>
                <p>The ASI Bulletin was a rebrand of the company newsletter that I helped manage and develop throughout the co-op. It was intended to be a showcase of all the important stories, classes, and oppertunities that ASI wanted to share to thier entire audience – from elementary school students to prospective adult investors. As someone who had a huge hand in the creation process, I helped write, design, and build the newsletter with help from the various teams at ASI. I was limited to using Wordpress and Elementor for the Web-Design aspects, but for the graphics I used a combination of Photoshop and Procreate.</p>
                <p>While creating it, my general thought process was that I wanted the newsletter to have a cleaner, more compact layout that also maintains the crafty, multimedia artstyle and early education aesthetic that characterizes the company. This thought-process ultimately culminated in the concept of having the newsletter rebranded as a literal bulletin board, like one that a public school would use to post announcements. For our newsletter each section would be a metaphorical "post" on this board, which I commuincated through skewmorphic design cues – such as using drop-shadows on images. </p>

                <u><b>UNDERSTANDING MINDS</b></u>
                <p>Understanding Minds was an educational series that covered various topics related to mental health and wellness. As a Video Editor, I was in charge of creating the visual identity for the show. Due to the desire to create these episodes quickly while also making it easy for anyone to potentially animate, I settled upon a sprite-based artstyle that's simple to work with and easy to reuse over time. The images you see below are my samples from this project.</p>

                <p>I also have a few samples of work from early on in production, where I played around with "craftier" artstyles and also started developing reference materials for the rest of the project. Most of these were scrapped and changed due to how time-consuming they were to create.</p>

                <u><b>ENDCARD REDESIGNS</b></u>
                <p>One of the smaller projects I did for the Video Team. Using a combination of Photoshop, Illustrator, and Procreate I designed a series of alternative endcards for use in future ASI videos. The idea was that we would swap out the endcards depending on the content of the video, which each slide featuring a different multi-media artstyle.</p>

            <div class="workDescription">
                <p>There were also a few unused endcards which were ultimately scrapped as development moved forward, such as the paint splatter varients for being too hard to read</p>

                <u><b>MISC.</b></u>
                <p>One of the projects which I unfortunately never got around to finishing was a proposed redesign for a series of educational pages about the United States. This project didn't make it further than the wireframing stage.</p>

            <div class="workDescription">
                <p>I also created a handful of smaller assets for use in videos. Below is one such example: an simple animation of a butterfly flapping its wings.</p>
